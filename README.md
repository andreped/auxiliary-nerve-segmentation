# auxiliary-nerve-segmentation

This is an old project from 2019, which I only uploaded to store it somewhere.

In this project I trained a binary and semantic deep segmentation model
to perform auxilary nerve segmentation in ultrasound scans.

The model was performed on independent 2D slices and the goal was to have a 
model that could be performed in real time using FAST.
